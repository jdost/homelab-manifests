## Application: Mealie

- [General Docs](https://docs.mealie.io/documentation/getting-started/introduction/)
- **NOTE** Requires the [CloudNativePG](../postgresql/controller/) for the
  relational datastore

App that stores/tracks recipes, web based replacement for recipe cards/cookbooks.
It uses postgresql for the database.  This is still in an assessment phase as I
don't yet know how it compares to the cloud solution we are already using.
