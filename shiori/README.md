## Application: Shiori

- [General Docs](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/blob/master/docs/Installation.md#using-kubernetes-manifests)
- **NOTE** Requires the [CloudNativePG](../postgresql/controller/) for the
  relational datastore

App that acts as a basic read-later style bookmark manager (it's meant to be a 
pocket clone).  Still assessing in my workflow (versus something more robust with
tagging and categorization).
