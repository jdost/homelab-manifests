## Application: AdventureLog

- [General Docs](https://adventurelog.app/docs/install/getting_started.html)
- **NOTE** Requires the [CloudNativePG](../postgresql/controller/) for the
  relational datastore
- Requires Rahsia to be available (to define the admin connection credentials)

General trip planning/ideating application for collecting points of interest, 
planning itineraries, and tracking trips.  This is still in an assessment phase
as I am unsure if it will get much utility or is just wishful thinking.
